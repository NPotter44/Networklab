# Networklab
The Network Tools & Technologies course lab scenario. In the scenario you work for a MSP who has been hired to build out a small business network.
You will build:
 
A SMB network, with a LAN, DMZ, and Guest network.
A Windows domain environment.
A IIS webserver.
A Windows FTP server.
A Win10 workstation.
A LAMP webserver running on Ubuntu, hosting a wiki.
A FortiGate firewall, with a VIP for the DMZ webserver.
 
After building the environment you will run a vlun scan against it using OpenVAS (Greenbone), and note your findings, and any recommendations to improve the environment.
