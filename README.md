The Network Tools & Technologies course lab scenario. In the scenario you work for a MSP who has been hired to build out a small business network. Your instructor will play the role of Senior Engineer for the MSP. You will follow documentation to build out the environment, if you need support, you can escalate to your Senior Engineer.
 
You will build:
 
A SMB network, with a LAN, DMZ, and Guest network.
A Windows domain environment.
A IIS webserver.
A Windows FTP server.
A Win10 workstation.
A LAMP webserver running on Ubuntu, hosting a wiki.
A FortiGate firewall, with a VIP for the DMZ webserver.
 
After building the environment you will run a vlun scan against it using OpenVAS (Greenbone), and note your findings, and any recommendations to improve the environment.
